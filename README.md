# Metalloidle

Guess the word in 6 tries. After each guess, the color of the tiles will
change to show how close your guess was to the word.

The word will consist of a sequence of nonmetal and metalloid
elemental symbols from the periodic table. 
All valid guesses must be words made from these symbols as well. 
(Note: keyboard typing has not yet been implemented on PC.)
