# Bigramle

Guess the word in 6 tries. After each guess, the color of the tiles will
change to show how close your guess was to the word.

The word will consist of a sequence of the bigrams (2-letter combinations) 
listed on the keyboard. 
All valid guesses must be words made from these bigrams as well. 
(If you are on PC, try typing them out!)
